# Installation

The Mapzen iOS SDK can be included in any iOS app via Cocoapods. It includes everything you need to get started, and includes a sample app you can also give a spin.

## Cocoapods

We're going to assume you have the latest stable build of Cocoapods installed. If not, check out how to install it over at https://cocoapods.org/

You can try out the SDK using:
`pod try Mapzen-ios-sdk`

Adding to your app is as simple as adding the following to your app's podfile:
`pod 'Mapzen-ios-sdk'`
